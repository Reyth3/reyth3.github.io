    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This document describes the collecting and use policy of the end-user&rsquo;s personal data by the LFMSync application.
        Be sure to read it if you want to know how the data is being processed, stored and used.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Collecting Data</h2>
    <p>The application collects the following data:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User&rsquo;s LastFM credentials;</li>
        <li>Application telemetry (e.g. crash logs, events etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gathered information</h2>
    <p>Gathered telemetry is used to improve LFMSync, and last.fm credentials are used to authenticate the user with the service.
        The data will never be sold, distributed, or transferred to any third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The credentials are not being stored on the user&rsquo;s device. They are only used for the authentication process through
        the official API. The only information stored on the end-user&rsquo;s device is the authentication token, which can
        be revoked on the last.fm website at any point.</p>
